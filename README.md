# BO.Tools.Zombies.CotD.EasterEgg.DialSolver

Context: In the game Call of Duty: Black Ops, there is a game mode in which you aim to survive as long as possible against increasingly strong waves of zombies called, at least to me, Zombies. There is a map called Call of the Dead, and in this map there is an easter eg with several steps. One of the steps involves there being 4 dials (1 on each floor for 4 consecutive floors) in a lighthouse. Each dial affects:
- the dial on the floor above (if it exists)
- the dial being rotated
- the dial on the floor below (if it exists)

So with that, there is a set combination to reach, and this solver was built to work out what moves you need to make to reach the combination.
